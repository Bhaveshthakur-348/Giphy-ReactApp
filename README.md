### `code description`

index.js -> App file -> Main.js -> Loader

In this project i used infinte scroll bar and loader 
Giphy api not send too much data they have some restriction because i add limit = 1000 but they don't send. so infinite scroll not properly working but you have primer features of giphy api so you put your own api and run.

for button : material-ui
for infinite scroll : react-infinite-scroll-component
for Loader : styled-components(css)
